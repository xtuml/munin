      :B,BCNT,name=Y,MCNT,user=D,name=Z;
      note right 
        B is source for both branch and merge count 
        in this example.
        It is also the user of the branch count 
      end note
      :C;
      :D;
      note right
        D will be the merge point. In this simple
        example the branch count and the merge count 
        should be the same at runtime. In other scenarios
        they could be different.
