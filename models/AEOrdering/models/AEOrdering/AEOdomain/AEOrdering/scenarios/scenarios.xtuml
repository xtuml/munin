	'The events to be verified by this system comes from numerous places across a distributed system.
As a result it is possible, even lilely, that events will be received out of sequence.

The events carry sufficient data to allow the correct sequence to be determined. 
The role of this domain is to reorder the received events into the correct sequence prior to
the sequence being validated.

This domain will therefore have to wait for out of sequence events to arrive. Timeouts will be
required to raise errors if events do not arrive within some acceptable time. The acceptable
time is to be determined but this may be specific to the source of the events.

the events that are received are related to a specific job. As soon as events are known to be in
the correct order they can be forwarded for verification. There is no need to wait for all of the 
events of a single job to be received before ordering can start.

It is likely that events from multiple jobs will concurrently be received by the system.
The event ordering is therefore job specific and there is no dependency between events from
different jobs.
