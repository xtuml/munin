== Protocol Verifier

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huginn_and_Muninn[Munin] is the nickname for
an application called 'Protocol Verifier' (PV).

Fundamentally, the Protocol Verifier observes and confirms that a job running
on a system under observation does what it was defined to do.  On the flip side,
the Protocol Verifier detects when a job running on a system under observation
violates the protocol prescribed for it.

The PV verifies that units of work (jobs) running within a system are
doing what they were designed to do and neither more nor less.  "Are you
doing what you said you are doing?"

The Protocol Verifier reports each job as finishing with status 'success',
'fail' or 'alarm'.

== Access and Getting Involved

The Protocol Verifier and associated utilities are Open Source Software.
You are welcome to fork, clone, raise issues and join in the
collaboration.

  Verifier and shows a running demonstration.

  a bit out of date.)

  into the JSON format consumed by Protocol Verifier.  This utility also
  runs in '--play' mode which interprets a job definition and produces a
  compliant stream of run-time audit events.  In other words, `plus2json --play`
  can simulate any system under observation.

  definitions provide examples of all of the various topologies and
  constraints supported by the Protocol Verifier.  (Edit them with a
  PlantUML capable editor to see the graphical representation.)
