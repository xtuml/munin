== Protocol Verifier

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huginn_and_Muninn[Munin] is the nickname for
an application called 'Protocol Verifier' (PV).

Fundamentally, the Protocol Verifier observes and confirms that a job running
on a system under observation does what it was defined to do.  On the flip side,
the Protocol Verifier detects when a job running on a system under observation
violates the protocol prescribed for it.

The PV verifies that units of work (jobs) running within a system are
doing what they were designed to do and neither more nor less.  "Are you
doing what you said you are doing?"

The Protocol Verifier reports each job as finishing with status 'success',
'fail' or 'alarm'.
