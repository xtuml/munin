= deploy README

The 'deploy' directory is an example of a deployment of the Protocol
Verifier and supporting Audit Event Simulator.  It is not a general
purpose runtime workspace but is simply an example of one.

As of March 2023, this deployment is populated with 5 Job Definitions and
a single Audit Event Data Definition.  These example Job Definitions are
derived from the PLUS Tutorial (1, 3, 5, 6, 13).  The corresponding
configuration files which govern the folder locations and timeouts are
also provided.

See the Munin HOWTO for further information on configuring the Protocol
Verifier.
