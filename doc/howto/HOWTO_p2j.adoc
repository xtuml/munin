= plus2json

This repository holds engineering artefacts for a PLUS language processor which
parses PLUS (based on PlantUML) and produces Protocol Verifier job definitions
formatted as JSON.

== Build

plus2json requires some files to be generated (Antlr-based parser and schema
gen). To generate the necessary files run:

  python bundle.py dev

NOTE: For this build to work, the `WORKSPACE` variable must be set to an
Eclipse workspace containing the `plus` BridgePoint project. The `antlr4-tools`
python package must also be installed.

== Run

To run plus2json in the repository, run:

  python -m plus2json

To print usage and help, run:

  python -m plus2json -h

== Test

To run unit tests, run:

  python -m unittest

== Usage

----
usage: python plus2json.pyz <command> [-v] [-h] [--debug] [--pretty-print] [-o dir]  [filenames ...]

plus2json is a utility for processing PLUS job definitions and producing JSON output for configuring and testing the Protocol Verifier.

Commands:
  --job                 Output PLUS job definition
  --play                Produce a stream of runtime audit events

Global Options:
  -v, --version         show program version number and exit
  -h, --help            Show this help message and exit
  --debug               Enable debug logging
  -p, --pretty-print    Print human readable debug/visualisation output
  -o dir, --outdir dir  Path to output directory
  filenames             Input .puml files

Play Options:
  --integer-ids         Use deterministic integer IDs (potentially useful for debugging but not normal testing)
  --msgbroker		Identifies the port on which the message broker is expecting to receive input messages
  --topic		Identifies the message broker topic to be used
  --shuffle		Mixes the order of events to test the PV capacity to cope with disordered events
  --rate		Defines the rate at which plus2json will generate events in events per second 
			(for a single instance of plus2json there is an upper limit of about 2000 events/second)
  --num-events		Specifies the number of events to generate in a single run of plus2json

Play Unhappy Event Options:
  --replace		Replaces the named event with one of the unhappy events defined for the job
  --sibling		Inserts an unhappy event (which is defined for the job) as a sibling 
                        of the named event i.e. the inserted unhappy event and the named event
			both refer to the same event in their previous event id field
  --insert		Inserts an unhappy event (which is defined for the job) as the predecessor 
                        of the named event i.e. the named event refers to the inserted unhappy event 
			in its previous event id field

Note: The behaviour of --play is non-deterministic when there is an unhappy event 
defined in the job definition with no other unhappy event options . It will 
either play the job with no unhappy events or it will randomly substitute an 
unhappy event for a critical event (as defined for the job).

Play Error Injection Options:
  --injectAb4B		Injects the first named event before the second name event
  --omit		Omits the named event but links the following event to the
			previous event so that the sequence continues


Job Definition Examples:
    # load Tutorial_1.puml and print a human readable version of the definition to the console
    python plus2json.pyz --job Tutorial_1.puml --pretty-print

    # load Tutorial_1.puml and print a human readable version of the definition to the console
    python plus2json.pyz --job -p Tutorial_1.puml

    # convert Tutorial_1.puml into JSON and output to the console
    python plus2json.pyz --job Tutorial_1.puml

    # convert all .puml files in the 'puml' directory and write each to a JSON file in 'job_definitions'
    python plus2json.pyz --job -o job_definitions puml/*.puml

Play Examples:
    # load Tutorial_1.puml and print a human readable stream of events to the console
    python plus2json.pyz --play Tutorial_1.puml--pretty-print

    # load Tutorial_1.puml and print a JSON stream of events to the console
    python plus2json.pyz --play Tutorial_1.puml

    # load all .puml files in the 'puml' directory and write steam of 
    events for each to a JSON file in 'job_definitions'
    python plus2json.pyz --play -o job_definitions puml/*.puml

    # run the play option on the set of 'puml' files represented by $puml_files and generate a 
    # stream of events to the Kafka message broker on port 9092 using topic Protocol_Verifier_Reception.
    # The events will be shuffled in order and a total of 100000 will be sent at the rate of 
    # 1000 events per second
    python plus2json.pyz --play $puml_files --msgbroker localhost:9092 --topic Protocol_Verifier_Reception  
    --shuffle --rate 1000 --num-events 100000

TODO Question: What tells p2j to keep generating events rather than just generate one set of events? Is
it merely the presence of --rate or --num-events. Should that be a variant of the --play option e.g. 
--play generates one set of events and --stream generates events continuously as defined by the
--rate and --num-events options?

Play Unhappy Event Option Examples:
    # run the play option on a single 'puml' file and generate an 
    # event stream in a file in the reception-incoming directory replacing
    # the CSJI event with one of the unhappy events in the job definition.
    python plus2json.pyz -o reception-incoming ACriticalJob1.puml --play --replace CSJI

    # run the play option on a single 'puml' file and generate an 
    # event stream in a file in the reception-incoming directory adding
    # a sibling unhappy event to the CSJD event. The unhappy event will be one
    # defined in the job definition.
    python plus2json.pyz -o reception-incoming ACriticalJob1.puml --play --sibling CSJD

    # run the play option on a single 'puml' file and generate an 
    # event stream in a file in the reception-incoming directory adding
    # an unhappy event as a predecessor to the CSJC event. The unhappy 
    # event will be one defined in the job definition.
    python plus2json.pyz -o reception-incoming ACriticalJob1.puml --play --insert CSJC

Play Error Injection Option Examples:
----
    # run the play option on a single 'puml' file and generate an 
    # event stream in a file in the reception-incoming directory adding
    # the event SSJA as a predecessor to the SSJE event. The injected
    # event will refer to original predecessor of SSJE and its predecessor
    python plus2json.pyz -o reception-incoming SimpleSequence.puml --play --injectAb4B SSJA SSJE

    # run the play option on a single 'puml' file and generate an 
    # event stream in a file in the reception-incoming directory omitting
    # the event SSJC from the sequence. The original successor of SSJC
    # will now refer to the original predecessor of SSJC as its predecessor.
    python plus2json.pyz -o reception-incoming SimpleSequence.puml --play --omit SSJC

=== Package for release

To package the `plus2json.pyz` bundle, run:

  python bundle.py

=== Data Model

This is the structure of the job definition. PLUS `.puml` files are parsed, and
instances of these classes are created and linked.
