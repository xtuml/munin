= PLUS User Guide

== Introduction

The Munin protocol verifier is dynamically configured using UML sequence
diagrams as input for defining valid sequences of events. A subset of the
PlantUML syntax forms a DSL for defining these sequences and PlantUML can be
used as a visualization tool.

== Specification

=== General Parsing Rules

The PLUS processor operates on a line by line basis. Each statement must be
fully contained on a single line. Blank lines are ignored.

Each line is split into tokens by whitespace. Extra whitespace characters are
ignored. Element names may not have spaces in them unless they are wrapped by
double quotes (`""`).

Display directives prepended with hash (`#`) or found inside square brackets
(`[]`) are ignored.

PLUS does not directly support code comments, however any line that does not
match one of the supported statements is silently ignored. PlantUML single line
comments (start with a single `'`) will work. PlantUML block comments
(surrounded by `/' ... '/`) will work as long as no valid statements are
contained in the block.

=== File Structure and Preprocessing

PLUS job definitions are defined in files with the `.puml` extension. Each
definition file must contain at least one UML block. The start of a UML block is
denoted by the `@startuml` statement on a line by itself and the end of the UML
block is denoted by the `@enduml` statement on a line by itself. There may be
more than one UML block defined in a single file. Optionally, an identifier can
be associated with a UML block. (TODO allow spaces between tokens in identifier
specification):

----
@startuml
...
@enduml

@startuml(id=block2)
...
@enduml

@startuml(id=block3)
...
@enduml
----

When a job definition file is processed, the first UML block is taken to be the
definition of the top level block and subsequent UML blocks are skipped. In
typical usage, a job definition file will either contain one default UML block
(top level job definition file) or one to many labeled UML blocks intended to be
`!include` -ed elsewhere.

PLUS supports the `!include` PlantUML statement during a preprocessor step using
the following syntax:

----
!include <filepath>!<block_identifier>
----

`<filepath>` is a valid relative filesystem path which refers to the `.puml`
file where the target UML block is defined. The path is relative to the location
of the original source file being processed. By convention, definition files
should start with an underscore (`_`) if they are not intended to be processed
as a top level job definition.

Includes are handled during preprocessing and simply inject the statements from
the target UML block in the place of the `!include` statement itself.

=== Statements

==== Job Name

The job name is defined by the `title` statement. Every top level job definition
_must_ have a name defined. If multiple `title` statements are encountered, the
last one wins:

----
title MyJob
title "My Job With Spaces"
----

==== Application/Participant

All participants in the sequence must be pre-declared. This is done with the
`participant` statement:

----
participant Participant1
participant Participant2
participant "Participant with Spaces"
----

==== Start/End Sequence Definition

A job consists of one or more disjoint sequences of events. A sequence can be
defined by surrounding a set of statements with a `box` definition. All audit
event statements must be defined with a sequence. (TODO throw error if this is
not the case):

----
box Sequence1 #LightBlue
...
end box
----

==== Sequence Start/End

Sequences can have multiple valid starting and ending points. The first event in
a sequence is automatically considered to be a sequence start event. Likewise,
the last event in a sequence is automatically considered to be a sequence end
event. Other start and events can be defined by sending messages between an
external "actor" and "participant" in the sequence diagram. An actor is defined
with the `actor` statement:

----
actor User
actor System
actor "Actor with Spaces"
----

Like participants, actors must be pre-declared. The name of the actor is not
used by the PLUS and is simply for documentation purposes.

==== Audit Event

Actual audit events in sequences are defined using the message statement. The
message must be defined between two pre-declared participants in the diagram.
The name of the message is the event name and uniquely identifies the event type
in the job. An additional occurrence number is used in some cases to identify
the instance of the event in the job definition:

----
teller -> customer: "Print Receipt"
----

==== Start/Stop/Resume Numbering

In cases where the same event is used in multiple places in a single job
definition, it is necessary to include an additional numeric value to identify
the occurrence of an event in a job sequence. Numbering can be controlled by the
following statements:

`autonumber` causes the processor to start automatically attaching occurrence
numbers to audit events with sequentially increasing integers starting at 1.

`autonumber stop` causes the processor to stop attaching occurrence numbers to
audit events. `autonumber stop` is not valid before an instance of `autonumber`
or `autonumber resume`.

`autonumber resume` causes the processor to restart attaching occurrence numbers
starting at the last number plus 1. `autonumber resume` is not valid before an
instance of `autonumber stop`

----
alice -> bob: "A"
autonumber
alice -> bob: "B"
alice -> bob: "C"
autonumber stop
alice -> bob: "D"
alice -> bob: "E"
autonumber resume
alice -> bob: "F"
alice -> bob: "G"
autonumber stop
alice -> bob: "H"
alice -> bob: "I"
alice -> bob: "J"
autonumber
alice -> bob: "K"
alice -> bob: "L"
alice -> bob: "M"
----

==== Alt/Else

Valid sequence definitions can branch into multiple distinct paths. This can be
specified using the `alt` and `else` groupings.

----
teller -> system: "Request withdrawal"
alt
system -> teller: "Report insufficient balance"
else
system -> teller: "Report success"
end
----

image::alt.png[Alt/else]

Each alt/else collection starts with a single `alt` statement followed by a
series of statements. An `else` statement can follow along with additional
statements. The whole collection is terminated by an `end` statement. There may
be any number of `else` branches. An `else` or `end` statement is invalid
without a preceding `alt` statement. Every `alt` statement must be terminated
with an `end` statement.

==== Loop

Valid sequences may have subsequences of events that occur repeatedly in a loop.
This can be  specified using the `loop` grouping.

----
client -> server: "Request file"
loop
server -> server: "Prepare packet"
server -> client: "Send packet"
end
server -> client: "Transfer complete"
----

===== Breaking from a loop

A loop can be constrained to a specific number of iterations or it can be
unconstrained. The sequence can also specify an event which breaks the loop
early. This is done by adding the word "break" as the secondary group label of
the branch of an `alt`:

----
client -> server: "Request file"
loop
alt
server -> server: "Prepare packet"
else break
server -> server: "Internal error"
end
server -> client: "Send packet"
end
server -> client: "Transfer result"
----

image::loopbreak.png[Loop with break]

The last event an alt branch marked with "break" is considered to be a break
event. The next event expected after a "break" event is the first event after
the end of the loop. There is currently no support for breaking from the outer
loop of a nested loop.
