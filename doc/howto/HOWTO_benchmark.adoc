= HOWTO Stress Test

xtUML Project Implementation Note

== 1 Abstract

This note is a "living" HOWTO guiding engineers to run the Protocol
Verifier (PV) under stressful loads.

== 2 Introduction and Background

A regression script exists which does a small amount of coverage testing
of the Protocol Verifier.  Stress testing also uses a script to set up and
run the PV.  The stress testing utilises features of `plus2json --play`
which repeatedly run jobs playing out audit event instance streams.

== 3 Requirements

=== 3.1 Guide Engineers in Protocol Verifier Testing

Information shall be provided that guides users and testers of the
Protocol Verifier to run in production configurations.

== 4 Work Required

. Document how to run the benchmarking script and general PV features.
. Document configuration variables.

== 5 Implementation Comments

N/A

== 6 Unit Test

When a random, intelligent engineer can follow these instructions and
successfully stess test the Munin PV, then unit test passes.

== 7 User Documentation

=== 7.1 Steps

. Navigate to munin/bin on your local machine.
. Start a remote Linux instance with munin repos pre-populated.
  (Substitute your own name for "dave".)
  .. `munin-ec2.sh start davePV`
. Log in to your remote Linux instance.
  .. `munin-ec2.sh login`
  .. `ssh -i ~/.ssh/pvlinuxtest.pem ubuntu@ec2-35-153-105-133.compute-1.amazonaws.com`
. Start a detachable terminal session to protect against network outages.
   * `tmux`
   * Detach with ctrl-b followed by d.
   * Reattach.
     ** `tmux attach`
. Navigate to munin/metrics.
. Delete the logs and cruft from previous runs.
  * `../bin/clean_for_benchmark.sh`
    ** (same as) `sudo rm -rf ../deploy/logs ../deploy/InvariantStore/ ../deploy/JobIdStore/ ../deploy/reception-incoming/ ../deploy/reception-processed/ ../deploy/p2jInvariantStore`
. Run `run_benchmark.sh` at 1000 events per second for 50000 events.
  * `run_benchmark.sh 1000 50000`
. Open a separate shell or log in to your Linux instance in a separate shell.
  * `munin-ec2.sh login`
. Observe the log files.
  .. Navigate to munin/deploy.
  .. Check for failed jobs.
     * `grep -c job_fail logs/verifier/*`
  .. Count successful jobs.
     * `grep -c job_succ logs/verifier/*`
  .. Count persisted JobIDs.  (Multiply by number of instances of PV.)
     * `wc JobIdStore/0-63/*`
. Log out of your remote Linux instance.
  .. `exit`
. Terminate your remote Linux instance.  (IMPORTANT:  machines left running cost money.)
  .. `munin-ec2.sh terminate`

=== 7.2 References

==== 7.2.1 plus2json

* Run `plus2json -h` to get help text which briefly documents all
  features.  Pay special attention to 'rate' and 'num-events'.

==== 7.2.2 Interesting Commands

* Delete unused docker images.
  ** `docker system prune`
* Delete unused docker volumes (e.g. Kafka logs).
  ** `docker volume prune`
* See CPU and memory usage.
  ** `docker stats --no-stream`
  ** `top`
* See disk usage.
  ** `df -vh`
