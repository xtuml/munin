= HOWTO release munin (and plus2json)

xtUML Project Implementation Note

== 1 Abstract

This note is a "living" HOWTO on the steps to release the Munin Protocol
Verifier and associated artefacts.

== 2 Introduction and Background

The initial development of the Munin Protocol Verifier followed a
schedule of roughly one release per calendar quarter.  After the first few
release cycles, the team began tagging the releases officially.  This
enabled more consistency in the testing cycles and the ability to
reproduce results from previous releases.  Simple tags were (are) used for
intermediate deliveries.

== 3 Requirements

=== 3.1 Enumerate Release Process

A step-by-step process for releasing the Munin Protocol Verifier shall be
enumerated.

== 4 Work Required

. Document (from memory) the steps to release Munin.
. Re-visit and refine this at the next and following release cycles.

== 5 Implementation Comments

N/A

== 6 Unit Test

. At the next release cycle, use this process and update it.

== 7 User Documentation

=== 7.1 Step-by-Step Release Process

==== 7.1.1 Release plus2json First

. Branch the plus2json repository.
. Bump the 'version' values in `bundle.py` and `setup.py`.
. Bundle plus2json.
  .. Export BPHOME as a path leading to your installation of BridgePoint.
     ... `export BPHOME=~/xtuml/2023-11-30txt/BridgePoint.app/Contents/Eclipse`
  .. Export WORKSPACE as a path leading to a workspace containing the
     xtUML model of PLUS.
     ...  `export WORKSPACE=~/ws/plus1`
  .. Run the bundle script.
     ... `python bundle.py`
     ... Ensure it ran cleanly with no errors and produced a new `plus2json.pyz`.
  .. Copy `plus2json.pyz` to your `munin/bin` folder.
. Commit and push.
. Prepare a pull request.
. Review and service the pull request.
. Create new release using GitHub.
  .. 'Releases' (within right-hand panes).
  .. 'Draft a new release'
  .. 'Choose a tag'
  .. Create a new tag.
  .. 'Publish release'

==== 7.1.2 Release munin Second

. Branch the plus2json repository.
. Bump the 'version' values in the `conanfile.py` of each model project.
  As of December 2023 these included the following:
  .. AEOrdering
  .. AEReception
  .. AsyncLogger
  .. FileReception
  .. InvariantStore
  .. PV_PROC
  .. SequenceVerificationDataCentric
  .. VerificationGateway
. Commit and push (including the updated binary `plus2json.pyz`).
. Prepare a pull request.
. Review and service the pull request.
. Create new release using GitHub.
  .. 'Releases' (along right-hand panes).
  .. 'Draft a new release'
  .. 'Choose a tag'
  .. Create a new tag.
  .. 'Publish release'
