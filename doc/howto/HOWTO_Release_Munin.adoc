= HOWTO release munin (and plus2json)

xtUML Project Implementation Note

== 1 Abstract

This note is a "living" HOWTO on the steps to release the Munin Protocol
Verifier and associated artefacts.

== 2 Introduction and Background

The initial development of the Munin Protocol Verifier followed a
schedule of roughly one release per calendar quarter.  After the first few
release cycles, the team began tagging the releases officially.  This
enabled more consistency in the testing cycles and the ability to
reproduce results from previous releases.  Simple tags were (are) used for
intermediate deliveries.

== 3 Requirements

=== 3.1 Enumerate Release Process

A step-by-step process for releasing the Munin Protocol Verifier shall be
enumerated.

== 4 Work Required

. Document (from memory) the steps to release Munin.
. Re-visit and refine this at the next and following release cycles.

== 5 Implementation Comments

N/A

== 6 Unit Test

. At the next release cycle, use this process and update it.

== 7 User Documentation

=== 7.1 Step-by-Step Release Process

Ensure that release notes have been written and are in the main branch of
the munin repository.  Both releases will refer to the release notes
document.

==== 7.1.1 Release plus2json First

First, release plus2json.  The HOWTO is found in <<dr-2>>.

==== 7.1.2 Release munin Second

. If changes have been made to plus2json:
  .. Branch the munin repository.
  .. Include the updated `plus2json.pyz` binary. Commit and push.
  .. Prepare a pull request.
  .. Review and service the pull request.
. Create new release using GitHub.
  .. 'Releases' (along right-hand panes).
  .. 'Draft a new release'
  .. 'Choose a tag'
  .. Create a new tag following semantic versioning principles (<<dr-3>>).
  .. Paste a link to the release notes document or type a short summary of
     the release in the body of the release.
  .. 'Publish release'
