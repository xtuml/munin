= Munin Configuration Data

xtUML Project Analysis Note

== 1 Abstract

This note identifies the configuration data that can be speficied for the 
Protocl Verifier in the MUNIN project.

== 2 Introduction and Background

There are several domains that make up the Protocol Verifier and they are all configured
by the JSON definition file pv-config.json.

== 3 Configuration

All configuration data that can impact how the Protocol Verifier operates are captured 
in the configuration file.

The following table identifies each of the configuration items, its description and the allowed types.

[cols="1,6,1,1"]
|===
| Name | Brief Description | Type | Default Setting

| SpecUpdateRate
| A time period that specifies how often the processes in the Protocol verifier will examine the 
configuration files (pv-config.json and job definition files)​ to check if it has been updated. 
If it has been updated it shall be reloaded.
| Duration
| 2 minutes
| IncomingDirectory
| If the Protocol Verfier has been deployed to use the File Reception domain and events are being 
delivered via files this is the directory where the File Reception process expects to find the 
JSON files containing the events​.
| String
| ./incoming
| ProcessedDirectory
| If the Protocol Verfier has been deployed to use the File Reception domain and events are being 
delivered via files this is the directory where the File Reception domain moves the JSON event files 
to after all the contained events have been processed.
| String
| ./processed
| ReceptionDeletionTime
| If the Protocol Verfier has been deployed to use the File Reception domain and events are being 
delivered via files when a file has been through reception the details of the reception processing 
shall be stored until this time expires​.
| Duration
| 10 minutes
| ConcurrentReceptionLimit
| A number that indicates the limit of concurrent reception jobs that can be executing, e.g. 1 = one 
active reception job
| Integer
| 1
| SchemaValidate
| A flag that indicates if json schema validation of incoming events hould be perfomred
| Boolean
| true
| SchemaValidateFrequency
| The frequency that validation of the events shall be performed. Every time the AcceptEvents interface 
of the Reception domain is invoked the schema validation count is incremented and when it reaches the 
SchemaValidateFrequency the events are validated. Currently this is defaulted to 1 ensuring all events are
validated when the AcceptEvents interface is invoked
| Integer
| 1
| FileControlWaitTime
| If the Protocol Verfier has been deployed to use the File Reception domain and events are being delivered 
via files this is the amount of time it shall wait between checking for files being available to process or 
if the ConcurrentReceptionLimit the amount of time it shall wait to check for capacity before checking for a 
file to process.
| Duration
| 1 second
| MaxOutOfSequenceEvents
| The maximum consecutive number of out-of-sequence events that can be received for a job before an error is 
declared.
| Integer
| 100
| MaximumJobTime
| The maximum time it should take for a job to be finished. When this time has been reached after the job was 
started it shall be archived (if there are no blocked events or failed if there are blocked events).​
| Duration
| 10 minutes
| JobCompletePeriod
| When a Job has completed it shall be either archived or failed and once the job complete period has expired 
it shall be deleted from the domain with all associated events.​
| Duration
| 24 hours
| JobDefinitionDirectory
| The directory where the Verifier process expects to find the Job Definitions.​
| String
| config/job_definitions
| DefaultJobExpiryDuration
| Job definitions can supply an expiry time and this is the time that jobs of that job type shall no longer be 
valid. If a expiry time is not supplied with the job definition the default job expiry is used for that job type.
| Duration
| 99 weeks
| DefaultStaleAuditEventDuration
| Job definitions can supply a stale event duration and this duration is used to determine if the event recieved 
is older than allowed for the event type by checking the provided event timestamp together with the stale event 
duration against the current time. If it exceeds the current time then the event is consider failed and the job 
shall fail. If the job definition deos not supply a stale audit event duration then the default shall be used.
| Duration
| 24 hours
| DefaultBlockedAuditEventDuration
| Job definitions can supply a blocked event duration and this duration is used to determine if a blocked event 
has been blocked for too long. When an event is blocked for longer than the blocked event duration the job is 
failed. If the job definition deos not supply a blocked audit event duration then the default shall be used.
| Duration
| 24 hours
| JobStoreLocation
| The directory where the Verifier process expects to find the Job ID Store.
| String
| ./JobIdStore
| JobStoreAgeLimit
| This defines how long the job ids will be retained in the Job Id Store.
| Duration
| 7 days
| InvariantStoreLoadRate
| This defines how frequently the invariant store is checked for changes. The detection of changes will prompt 
the upload of the new invariants to each running instance of the Verifier process.​
| Duration
| 2 minutes
| MaxIntraSequenceEventTimeoutPeriod
| The period of time that the Protocol Verifier waits for a subsequent sequence (if any) before it considers the 
Job to have completed.​
| Duration
| 1 second
| WaitPeriodForAllJobsCompletedCheck
| The period of time the Protocol Verifier waits after a  Job Definition has been deprecated before that Job 
Definition is deleted.​
| Duration
| 1 day
| WaitPeriodForJobDeletion
| The period of time after a Job has completed (whether succeeded or failed) that the Protocol Verifier waits 
before that Job, and all its associated audit events, are deleted.​
| Duration
| 30 minutes
| WaitPeriodForInvariantDeletion
| The period of time after an Extra Job Invariant has gone ‘out of force’ before it is deleted.​
| Duration
| 1 day
| TimeoutPeriodForRetreivingStoredInvariants
| The period of time after requesting the restoration of an Extra Job Invariant from the Invariant Store that the 
Protocol Verifier waits before giving up and assuming that the respective Invariant is not available.​
| Duration
| 10 seconds
| TimeoutPeriodForHangingJob
| The period of time that the job will wait until it considers it has timed out because it hasn't seen a complete 
expected sequence of events within the period or because of a blocked event timeout for a job.
| Duration
| 15 seconds


| MaxJobsPerWorker
| This is the maximum number of jobs that can be assigned to any one workeri
| Integer
| 30000

| MaxUnassignedJobs
| This is the maximum number of jobs that can be unassigned before job Management 
reports jobmanagement_exceeded_max_jobs
| Integer
| 100000

| RetiredWorkerDeletionTime
| The amount of time a retired worker is held in Job Management before it is 
deleted. This allows for a worker who is no longer registered to re-register.
| Duration
| 10 minutes

| WorkerHeartbeatRate
| The rate at which a worker should send the worker heartbeat to Job Management
| Duration
| 1 minute

| WorkerHeartbeatFailureThreshold
| The number of missed heartbeats that have to occur before Job 
Management determines the worker is absent and retires the worker
| Integer
| 3
