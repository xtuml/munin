* Where do job definitions come from?
* How many events per job will there be (on average)?
* What percentage of jobs will define unhappy events?
* What percentage of jobs will use intra-job invariants?
* What percentage of jobs will use extra-job invariants?
* What is the expected expiration/longevity of extra-job invariants?
* How will the PV be notified of compromised invariants?
* What are the requirements on back-end reporting (alarms, failures, successes)?
* What technology will the back-end reporting use?  (kafka, stroom, etc)
* Can we deprecate support for Inclusive OR forks?
