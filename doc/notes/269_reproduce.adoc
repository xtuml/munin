# 269 Reproduction

## Scenario

1. In one shell, run `./run_benchmark.sh 3000 1000000`
  * This launches the Protocol Verifier with one instance of
    JobManagement (manager), 4 instances of AEO_SVDC (workers) an
    instance of IStore (a singleton managing a persistent store) and an
    instance of ActiveMQ.
  * This runs `plus2json --play` to synthesise 1000000 audit events at
    3000 events/second (but achieving a rate substantially lower than
    that due to CPU and I/O limits).
  * I am running a 2 years old MacBook Air M2.  Depending upon your machine
    you may need to adjust the 3000 up or down a bit.
2. In another shell, run `python ../metrics/pvdashboard.py --amqpbroker localhost:61613 2> /tmp/o1.txt`
  * This runs a back-end "dashboard" which displays results and
    statistics.
  * The `stderr` gets a few interesting log messages including a note on
    whether the top end 'Protocol_Verifier_Reception' topic is enabled
    (auto_credit = true and credit = positive integer) or disabled
    (auto_credit = false and credit = 0).  This updates once per second.
    I sometimes `tail -f` the log file in a separate shell.
3. When you have hit a problem, you will see the dashboard report that
   events are no longer being processed.  When you look at the docker stats
   for the containers, you will see them going idle.
4. In `munin/deploy/config/benchmarking-config.json` there are two values
   that may need to be adjusted, 'MaxJobsPerWorker' and 'MaxUnassignedJobs'.
   These control when the Audit Event Reception state machine throttles the
   Reception topic.

## Reproduction Branch

Branch '269_recreate' (https://github.com/xtuml/munin/tree/269_recreate)
is tweaked for reproduction of the issue.  A few extra log messages are
enabled.  The docker compose files are adjusted.  The benchmarking script
is adjusted to operate from a local build of Protocol Verifier.

## Steps

1. Fire up docker.
2. Build branch '269_recreate'
   (https://github.com/xtuml/munin/tree/269_recreate).
3. In one shell navigate to `munin/metrics` and run:  `run_benchmark.sh 3000 1000000`
4. In another shell navigate to `munin/deploy` and run `python ../metrics/pvdashboard.py --amqpbroker localhost:61613 2> /tmp/o1.txt`
5. In another shell, watch container CPU. `docker stats`.
6. In another shell, interrogate the status of the
   'Protocol_Verifier_Reception' topic in JobManagement, `tail -f /tmp/o1.txt`
7. In a browser, monitor the ActiveMQ message broker, `localhost:8161`
