= Protocol Verifier Deployment Readiness

xtUML Project Analysis Note

== 1 Abstract

This note provides analysis of deployment readiness for the Protocol
Verifier.  Requirements are outlined.  Work to accomplish the readiness
will be done and documented in sub-tasks with references.

== 2 Introduction and Background

=== 2.1 Terminology

development team::
One team will be responsible for engineering the Protocol Verifier
application and supporting applications.  This team will be referred to
as the 'development team'.

support team::
A 'support team' will be responsible for ongoing deployment support of the
Protocol Verifier and accompanying applications.  The support team will be
involved in development to supply, classify and prioritise requirements on
the deployability and supportability of the system.

=== 2.2 Challenges

The Protocol Verifier may be deployed in a secure and isolated environment
requiring minimal dependencies on external software components and
libraries.  In addition, the Protocol Verifier must be maintainable by
technicians with little to no software development experience.

== 3 Requirements

=== 3.1 Minimal Base Linux

* Minimise the operating system and dependent components to what is
  absolutely necessary.
* Each container will have only the executable(s) required for its own
  functionality.

=== 3.2 Up-to-Date Software Components

Update operating system and dependent software components to current yet
stable versions.

=== 3.3 User Mode Execution

Run with user-level permissions (e.g. without root).

=== 3.4 Shared File System Restriction

* Applications may not communicate with each other through a shared file
  system on the host or through a volume.
* Configuration files on the host shall be mounted as read-only within the
  containers.
* Any writable volumes will be writable by only a single container and not
  mounted or accessed by other containers (e.g. InvariantStore SQLite
  database file).
* File access shall be clearly documented and reviewed.
* The bandwidth of traffic accessing files shall be calculated and documented.

=== 3.5 RabbitMQ Message Broker

Support RabbitMQ as the message broker for intra- and inter- component
communication.

TODO: This is still in discussion.

=== 3.6 TLS and Authentication

* Authenticate all messaging participants.
* Encrypt intra-component messaging.
* Encrypt inter-component messaging.
* Employ standard and configurable protocols throughout.

=== 3.7 Exemplar Implementation

Provide an exemplar (preferred embodiment) of the Protocol Verifier
application configured with reasonable defaults.

=== 3.8 Documentation

* Document the Protocol Verifier application and its use.
* Follow documentation standards familiar to popular Open Source Software
  projects such as READMEs and HOWTOs.
* Maintain documentation in close proximity to the application software.

=== 3.9 User Training and Knowledge Transfer

Provide training and explanations to ensure the support team has the
knowledge necessary to maintain the Protocol Verifier application on an
on-going basis.

=== 3.10 Report on MASL {cpp} Portability

Analyse the MASL {cpp} model compiler and document dependencies and
ortability.

* Identify key dependencies on operating systems, libraries and software
  components.
* Prioritise by degree of difficulty the reduction of dependencies and
  increases in portability.
* Estimate the effort required to run MASL {cpp} generated code on
  a few choice distributions of Linux.
* Estimate the effort required to run MASL {cpp} generated code on
  VxWorks.
* Estimate the effort required to run MASL {cpp} generated code on
  Windows.

== 4 Analysis

=== 4.1 Minimal Base Linux
=== 4.2 Up-to-Date Software Components
=== 4.3 User Mode Execution
=== 4.4 Shared File System Restriction
=== 4.5 RabbitMQ Message Broker
=== 4.6 TLS and Authentication
=== 4.7 Exemplar Implementation
=== 4.8 Documentation
=== 4.9 User Training and Knowledge Transfer
=== 4.10 Report on MASL {cpp} Portability

== 5 Work Required

=== 5.1 Minimal Base Linux

. Start from minimal base as recommended by the support team.
. Remove the MASL {cpp} compiler and associated build chain.
. Add in the necessary runtime libraries.
. Provide a separate image for each build.  For example, the
  InvariantStore application will be alone on an image.

=== 5.2 Up-to-Date Software Components
=== 5.3 User Mode Execution
=== 5.4 Shared File System Restriction
=== 5.5 RabbitMQ Message Broker
=== 5.6 TLS and Authentication
=== 5.7 Exemplar Implementation
=== 5.8 Documentation
=== 5.9 User Training and Knowledge Transfer
=== 5.10 Report on MASL {cpp} Portability

== 6 Acceptance Test

=== 6.1 Regression

Run the `regression.sh` script and see it pass.

=== 6.2 Benchmark Stress

Run the `run_benchmark.sh` script and see it pass with adequate throughput.
