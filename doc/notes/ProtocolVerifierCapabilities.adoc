= Protocol Verifier Capabilities

xtUML Project Analysis Note

== 1 Abstract

This note briefly outlines the verification and detection capabilities of
the Munin Protocol Verifier.

== 2 Introduction and Background

=== 2.1 Terminology

system under observation::
A computer system or application that is being observed and verified for
correct behaviour through telemetry and protocol verification.

protocol::
A protocol is a well-defined set of rules governing the format and
sequencing of information that is exchanged between computers or computer
processes.

job::
A named task running on the system under observation.  A job will complete
a specific cohesive task (such as transferring a file or debiting an
account in a banking application).  A job will produce audit events which
are delivered as telemetry to the Protocol Verifier.  A well-behaved job
will produce predictable audit event telemetry every time the job runs.

audit event::
Sometimes 'event' for short, an audit event is a single named atom of
telemetry produced by a job running on a system under observation.  Audit
events are produced by instrumentation (tracing) inside the computer
program(s) running as part of the job.  Example audit events might be:
"packet arrived at gateway", "account debited", "authorisation granted".

audit event sequence::
An audit event sequence is an ordered set of audit events.  Sequencing is
the single most important and useful relationship between the audit events
in a job.

job definition::
A job definition is a PLUS (PlantUML) description/prescription for the
protocol of a specific job running on the system under observation.  The
job definition defines the expected behaviour of the job running on the
system under observation.  In a concise manner, a job definition describes
all of the possible legal paths for the job to take.  A job definition
also can define legal ways that a job experiences expected error
conditions.
+
A job definition can be thought of as like a 'recipe' for a job with the
audit events being the steps in the recipe.

=== 2.2 Example Job Definition

== 3 Requirements

=== 3.1 Present Capabilities

Enumerate capabilities for verification and detection as presently (May
2024) in the Protocol Verifier.

=== 3.2 Potential Capabilities

Enumerate capabilities for verification and detection that could
potentially be implemented with reasonable engineering effort.

== 4 Analysis

Fundamentally, the Protocol Verifier confirms that a job running on a
system under observation does what it was defined to do.  On the flip
side, the Protocol Verifier detects when a job running on a system under
observation violates the protocol prescribed for it.

The Protocol Verifier verifies that jobs are doing what they were designed
to do and nothing more or less.  "Are you doing what you said you are
doing?"

=== 4.1 Present Capabilities

* Verify that an event occurs.
* Verify that all events occur.
* Verify that events occur in the prescribed order (sequence).
* Verify that only one event occurs in an XOR fork.
* Verify that all events occur in an AND fork.
* Verify that prescribed merges occur after forks.
* Verify that a branch prescribed in the protocol occurs and that it
  occurs the prescribed number of times.
* Verify that a loop cycles the prescribed number of times.
* Verify that events marked as 'Critical' do not occur when 'Unhappy' events are present.
* Verify that an event is carrying an invariant (key) that matches the
  expected value established earlier in the job.
* Verify that an event is carrying an invariant that matches the expected
  value established in a previous job.

=== 4.2 Potential Capabilities

* "Grade" job definitions on their strength to detect correct behaviour.
* Identify statistical deviations in legally running jobs.  (This job
  takes path X 99.9% of the time but has recently been taking a different
  path.)
* Identify statistical deviations in the mix of jobs.  (The percentage and
  balance of job types has recently changed significantly.)
