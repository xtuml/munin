=== 4.2 Questions

* I think 'partition' means 'job', so we do not need a **Job Definition** key.
* I think 'group' means 'sequence', so we do not need a **Sequence Definition** key.
* Double-quotes should wrap multi-word identifiers.
* Instead of using a note for invariants, let us simply add comma separated values to the event.
  ** :A,invariant:name=X,user=G;
* I suggest that we define branch counts only on the event where the branch occurs.
  ** :B,branchcount name=X;
* How is the source of a loopcount useful?
* I suggest that we define loop counts only on the first event inside the loop.
  ** :B,loopcount name=X;
